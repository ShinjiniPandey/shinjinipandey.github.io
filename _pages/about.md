I am an applied microeconomist whose research focuses on labor economics, particularly criminal justice, and development economics.

My research in criminal justice has involved examining inequities and biases in the public safety system and identifying strategies to improve police response outcomes. I am studying how racial and ethnic identity of individuals involved in emergencies impacts 911 call handling by dispatchers, and evaluating alternative programs implemented by the Columbus police to improve behavioral health crisis response. In addition, another strand of my work in development focuses on food security, nutrition, and sustainable agricultural practices.
