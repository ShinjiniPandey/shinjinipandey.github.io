I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Economics at Duke University, an SSRC–Arnold Ventures Criminal Justice Innovation Fellow, and a Visiting Research Scholar at NBER. My research spans labor economics—with a focus on criminal justice—and development economics.

In my criminal justice work, I examine inequities in the public safety system and evaluate strategies to improve police response. This has included studying how the racial and ethnic identity of individuals involved in emergencies affects 911 call handling by dispatchers, as well as assessing alternative response programs implemented by the Columbus Division of Police to improve outcomes in behavioral health crisis situations.

Another strand of my research in development economics focuses on food security, nutrition, and sustainable agricultural practices.
